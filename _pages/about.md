<p>Presently, I am working as a post-doctoral researcher in <b>Living Analytics Research Centre (LARC)</b> at <b>School of Computing and Information Systems</b>, <b>Singapore Management University</b> under supervision of Prof. Archan Misra. My research is primarily focused in the areas of the Embedded Sensing, Ubiquitous Computing, Low-power System Design, and Internet-of-Things (IoT). <br> <br>

Prior to LARC, I have received by Ph.D. training from IIIT-Delhi under wonderful supervision of Dr. Shobha Sundar Ram (Department of Electronics Engineering) and Dr. Amarjeet Singh (Joint faculty - Department of Computer Science and Electronics Engineering).

During my doctoral studies, I have worked as a visiting researcher with Prof. Shwetak Narain Patel (University of Washington, Seattle, USA) and Sidhant Gupta (Microsoft Research, Redmond) at Ubicomp Lab <b>Paul G. Allen Centre for Computer Science and Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA (USA)</b> from 2016-2018. <br>

After completing my doctoral research, I have also spent some time consulting with a few technology startups i.e. Aerogram India Pvt. Ltd. focusing on Distributed Air Quality Monitoring and Child Health Imprints Pte. Ltd. which leverages power of IoT for neonatal health monitoring in NICU's. <br> <br> I have also served a short stint at IIT Kanpur as a visiting faculty for E-ICT Academy in 2019 Summer.

Before joining IIIT-Delhi, I have worked with <b>Hewlett-Packard Educational services (Noida) </b> and <b> Indrion Technologies (Bangalore) </b> as Embedded Design Engineer where we designed and deployed Wireless Sensor Networks for Smart Energy applications. I received my B.Tech (Hons.) in Electronics and Communication Engineering in 2011 from <b> Maharishi Dayanand University, Rohtak</b>. <br> </p>
